# XSLT Example
This repository contains **an example** XSLT stylesheet which aims to show how the data in the [GP Connect - Update Record v1.1.1-public-beta](https://simplifier.net/guide/gp-connect--update-record--itk3/Home/Introduction/Release-notes?version=1.1.1-public-beta) specification can be applied.

## :warning: Important
This XSLT has had some input from clincians; however, it has not undergone any extensive testing.
It should be used **only for reference**, and **it is not** production-ready.
